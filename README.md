You are given two integers n and k. This is a JS function that generates and return the following sequence: • The first element is 1 • Every following element equals the sum of the previous k elements • The length of the sequence is n elements The input comes as two number arguments. The first element represents the number n, and the second – the number k. The output is the return value of your function and should be an array of numbers.

The 2nd element (1) is the sum of the 3 elements before it, but there is only 1, so we take that. The third element is the sum of the first 2 (1 and 1) and the 4th – the sum of 1, 1, and 2. The 5th element is the sum of the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th (1, 2, and 4) and so on.
